Each directory (or sub-directory of 'gae') contains an example server
in a particular language designed to handle audio incoming from the
Wami recorder.

The PHP example requires the configuration of a PHP-enabled
web-server, while the python server can be run on any machine with
python installed.

If you do not wish to host your own server, you can try out the Google
App Engine (GAE) examples.  The GAE python example stores data in a
"blobstore", for which Google provides a handy web-based management
console.
